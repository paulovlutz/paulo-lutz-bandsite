BrainStation: Bandsite Project

This project was created during the course of three weeks at the Web Development Program (Spring Cohort 2020) at BrainStation.

On the Sprint 1: I had to build a responsive web-site based on the provided mock ups and design specs.

On the Sprint 2: I had to make the site interactive using JavaScript, and to add a second page to the site according to the mockups and design specs.

On the Sprint 3: I had to now make the site functional with comment and show data from the server, where before I had hard-coded mock data.
